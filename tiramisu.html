<h3>Preparation and cooking time</h3>
Prep:30 mins plus chilling<br>
Easy<br>
Serves 6<br>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>400ml double cream</li>
    <li>250g mascarpone</li>
    <li>75ml marsala</li>
    <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>300ml coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
    <li>175g sponge fingers</li>
    <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
    <li>2tsp cocoa powder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>

STEP 1<br>
Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.<br>
<br>
STEP 2<br>
Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.<br>
<br>
STEP 3<br>
Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until youâ€™ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.<br>
<br>
STEP 4<br>
Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.<br>
<br>
STEP 5<br>
Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.<br>
<br>
STEP 6<br>
To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.<br>
